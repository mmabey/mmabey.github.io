If we were to meet in person, the conversation might go something 
like this:

    "Wow, you're tall!"

    "Thanks."

    "How tall are you?"

    "6'11"."

    "Wow! That's so tall! Is everyone in your family tall?"

    "Yes, but I'm the tallest."

    "Do you play basketball?"

    "Nope."

    "Why not?"

    "All my good parts are above my shoulders."

So there you go. Now we don't have to have that conversation.

Blah blah, now I have a website.
