Group Project

Overview
--------

The purpose of this project is to write code that pertains to each of the three main tasks of the forensic process:
acquisition, authentication, and analysis. Since the project will require many address conversions, you are also
required to write a utility that can convert between multiple hard drive address types, the details of which are below.
The code you write for this project should be in a Linux-compatible language (e.g. C/C++, Java, Python, Perl, etc.).


Tool 1: Address Conversion Utility (40pts)
------------------------------------------

In order to both simplify addressing mechanisms and to reduce the number of bits necessary to locate all areas within a
logical space (like a partition) that hold data, multiple addressing techniques are used on IBM PC-compatible hard
drives and in FAT file systems. You are to write a Unix-like command line utility that will convert between three
different address types when an address of a different type is given. Use the following usage specifications for your
utility:

::

    address4forensics -L|-P|-C [-b offset] [-B [-s bytes]] [-l address] [-p address] [-c address -k sectors -r sectors -t tables -f sectors]


Where the parameters must conform to the following specifications:

   -L, --logical
         Calculate the logical address from either the cluster address or
         the physical address. Either ``-c`` or ``-p`` must be given.
   -P, --physical
         Calculate the physical address from either the cluster address
         or the logical address. Either ``-c`` or ``-l`` must be given.
   -C, --cluster
         Calculate the cluster address from either the logical address or
         the physical address. Either ``-l`` or ``-p`` must be given.
   -b offset, --partition-start=offset
         This specifies the physical address (sector number) of the start
         of the partition, and defaults to 0 for ease in working with
         images of a single partition. The ``offset`` value will always
         translate into logical address 0.
   -B, --byte-address
         Instead of returning sector values for the conversion, this
         returns the byte address of the calculated value, which is the
         number of sectors multiplied by the number of ``bytes`` per sector.
   -s bytes, --sector-size=bytes
         When the ``-B`` option is used, this allows for a specification of
         ``bytes`` per sector other than the default 512. Has no affect on
         output without ``-B``.
   -l address, --logical-known=address
         This specifies the known logical ``address`` for calculating either
         a cluster address or a physical address. When used with the ``-L``
         option, this simply returns the value given for ``address``.
   -p address, --physical-known=address
         This specifies the known physical ``address`` for calculating either
         a cluster address or a logical address. When used with the ``-P``
         option, this simply returns the value given for ``address``.
   -c address, --cluster-known=address
         This specifies the known cluster ``address`` for calculating either
         a logical address or a physical address. When used with the ``-C``
         option, this simply returns the value given for ``address``. Note
         that options ``-k``, ``-r``, ``-t``, and ``-f`` must be provided with this
         option.
   -k sectors, --cluster-size=sectors
         This specifies the number of sectors per cluster.
   -r sectors, --reserved=sectors
         This specifies the number of reserved sectors in the partition.
   -t tables, --fat-tables=tables
         This specifies the number of FAT tables, which is usually 2.
   -f sectors, --fat-length=sectors
         This specifies the length of each FAT table in sectors.


An example of this in use would be the following, where the desired number is the logical address of physical sector
12345678 in a partition that begins at physical sector 128::

   $ address4forensics -L -b 128 --physical-known=12345678
   12345550

Another example shows the utility getting the physical address of cluster 58, in a partition that begins at physical
sector 128, has 2 FAT tables that are each 16 sectors long, 6 reserved sectors, and 4 sectors per cluster::

   $ address4forensics -P --partition-start=128 -c 58 -k 4 -r 6 -t 2 -f 16
   390

Tool 2: MAC Conversion Utility (20pts)
--------------------------------------

The purpose of this task is to write code that performs the MAC conversion based on the following
usage specification and input/output scheme. This conversion MUST follow the procedure that we
discussed in the lecture. We assume a little endian ordering is applied.::

   mac_conversion -T|-D [-f filename | -h hex value ]


Where the parameters must conform to the following specifications:

   -T  Use time conversion module. Either ``-f`` or ``-h`` must be given.
   -D  Use date conversion module. Either ``-f`` or ``-h`` must be given.
   -f filename
         This specifies the path to a filename that includes a hex value
         of time or date. Note that the hex value should follow this
         notation: ``0x1234``. For the multiple hex values in either a file
         or a command line input, we consider only one hex value so the
         recursive mode for MAC conversion is optional.
   -x hex_value
         This specifies the hex value for converting to either date or
         time value. Note that the hex value should follow this notation:
         ``Ox1234``. For the multiple hex values in either a file or a
         command line input, we consider only one hex value so the
         recursive mode for MAC conversion is optional.

The converted time or date value should be based on the following scheme::

   Time: hr:min:sec AM|PM
   Date: Month day, Year

An example of this in use would be the following, where the time conversion is requested with a file::

   $ mac_conversion -T -f test.txt
   Time: 10:31:44 AM

Another example shows the date conversion with the hex value as an input::

   $ mac_conversion -D -h 0x4f42
   Date: Feb 15, 2013


Tool 3: Acquisition, Authentication, and Analysis (40 pts)
----------------------------------------------------------

For this project, it is assumed that the work of acquiring a digital copy of a hard drive has already been
performed. The following requirements should be accomplished in your code: a single package is
preferred. A sample raw image and corresponding information are available at Blackboard.

Requirement a) First, you are to write a program that can take as input the path to a RAW image and
open it as read-only for the requirements (b) and (c).

Requirement b) Before opening the RAW image, your program should first calculate MD5 and SHA1
checksums for the image. Both checksums should be stored as MD5-image-name.txt and SHA1-imagename.txt.
For example, the name of RAW image is Sparky then your authentication module needs to
generate MD5-Sparky.txt and SHA1-Sparky.txt before opening the RAW image.

Requirement c) The next tasks your program must be able to accomplish are:

1. Locate and extract the partition tables from the master boot record (MBR)

   a. Your program MUST generate the partition type including hex value and corresponding type, start sector address,
   and size of each partition in decimal as follows::

         (07) NTFS, 0002056320, 0000208845

2. For FAT16/32 partition, read each partitionâ€™s volume boot record (VBR) and retrieve the geometric data of the file
   system. Your code MUST generate the following layout information:

   a. The layout should include::

         Reserved area: Start sector: 0 Ending sector: 6 Size: 7 sectors
         Sectors per cluster: 32 sectors
         FAT area: Start sector: 7 Ending sector: 598
         Number of FATs: 2
         The size of each FAT: 249 sectors
         The first sector of cluster 2: 12234 sectors

      .. note:: For the partition types, please refer to the lecture notes.
