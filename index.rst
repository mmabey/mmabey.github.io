I'm a PhD student at `Arizona State University <https://www.asu.edu>`_
majoring in Computer Science with an emphasis in `Information Assurance
<http://ia.asu.edu>`_. I do research in the `Laboratory of Security
Engineering for Future Computing (SEFCOM) <http://sefcom.asu.edu>`_ on
digital forensics.

My motivation for studying computer security is summarized by this quote:

| "We believe that the commission of crime should be punished according to
    the nature of the offense; that murder, treason, robbery, theft, and the
    breach of the general peace, in all respects, should be punished
    according to their criminality and their tendency to evil among men, by
    the laws of that government in which the offense is committed; and for
    the public peace and tranquility all men should step forward and use
    their ability in bringing offenders against good laws to punishment."
| -*Joseph Smith Jr.* [1]_
|


I want to be a part of the solution to make the Internet safe for all people
to use, regardless of their technical skill or ability to understand how
systems interconnect and interact with each other.
