I'm a PhD candidate at `Arizona State University <https://www.asu.edu>`_
majoring in Computer Science with an emphasis in `Information Assurance
<http://ia.asu.edu>`_. I do research on digital forensics in the `Laboratory
of Security Engineering for Future Computing (SEFCOM) <http://sefcom.asu.edu>`_
which is connected to the `Center for Cybersecurity and Digital Forensics (CDF)
<https://cdf.asu.edu>`_.

And in case you were wondering, I'm 6'11", and no, I don't play basketball.

My motivations as an aspiring professor are as follows:

:Teaching: I want to inspire students in Computer Science to do one of two things: join the ranks of researchers that
    improve computer security, or at least be aware of the security issues in computer science and be more responsible
    computer scientists.

:Research: I want to make it safer for people to use technology, so I study computer security issues and I develop
    techniques for catching criminals using digital evidence.

:Service: I want to contribute to the institution, professional organizations, and community to which I belong.
