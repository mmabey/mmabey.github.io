I'm an Integrations Engineer at `Cedar <https://www.cedar.com/>`_. I'm passionate about the `Python
<https://python.org>`_ programming language, `3D printing <https://www.thingiverse.com/mikemabey/designs>`_, and
teaching.

I graduated with my PhD in Computer Science (with an emphasis in `Information Assurance <http://ia.asu.edu>`_) from
`Arizona State University <https://www.asu.edu>`_ in December 2017. While I was at ASU, I was part of the `Laboratory of
Security Engineering for Future Computing (SEFCOM) <http://sefcom.asu.edu>`_ which is connected to the `Center for
Cybersecurity and Digital Forensics (CDF) <https://cdf.asu.edu>`_.

And in case you were wondering, I'm 6'11", and no, I don't play basketball.

.. My motivations as an aspiring professor are as follows:

   :Teaching: I want to inspire students in Computer Science to do one of two things: join the ranks of researchers that
    .. improve computer security, or at least be aware of the security issues in computer science and be more responsible
    .. computer scientists.

   :Research: I want to make it safer for people to use technology, so I study computer security issues and I develop
    .. techniques for catching criminals using digital evidence.

   :Service: I want to contribute to the institution, professional organizations, and community to which I belong.
